Difference Between Document And Window Object



DOCUMENT

     * It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the web browser.
     
     * It is loaded inside the window.

     * It is the object of window property.

     * All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.

     * We can access the document from a window using the window. document.

     * The document is part of BOM (Browser object model) and DOM (Document object model)

     * Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accesssed by a window like this    window.document.title


WINDOW OBJECT

     * It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of webpage.

     * It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.

     * It is the object of the browser.

     * Global objects, functions,and variables of javascript are members of the window object. 

     * We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window

     * The window is part of BOM, notDOM.

     * Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
